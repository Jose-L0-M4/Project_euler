value = 0# This code snippet is intended to print numbers from 0 to 1000 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
# However, the original code is incomplete. Let's complete it.
for i in range(1000):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
        value += i
print(value)  # This will print the sum of all numbers from 0 to 1000 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

#Multiples of 3 or 5
